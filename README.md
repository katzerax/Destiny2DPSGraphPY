D2 Weapon DPS graph

This is a python file that will produce a graph showing the destiny 2 DPS for certain weapons. It has configurable variables for all sorts of things, but is presuming that you are firing until your mag is empty, reloading, and immediately firing until you are out of ammo. Co-written with my friend Roxy (https://twitter.com/rokishee).
